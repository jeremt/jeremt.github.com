### C/C++

#### UNIX System

Along my first year, I have realized several *nix projects, like (re)code - in C - some core functions (printf, ls) or a [complete shell](#shell).

#### Graphical interface

I have been able to experiment with the SDL, and I have achieved several projects with MinilibX (superset of Epitech's LibX) :

- a "wireframe" able to generate a terrain from a map, within a parallel or isometric view
- a raycasting engine, in order to create a game similar to [Wolfenstein 3d](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D)
- a [raytracer](#rt) with shadow, reflection and refraction management...

#### Prog elem'

An Epitech's module, during which one has to realize elementary programmation, like sorting algorythms or infinite numbers calculator.

### Scripting

I made some __shell script__ and command line tools in __python__, __c__ or __javascript__.


### Web development

- In __frontend development__  I used libraries like _requireJS_ and _backbone_ to create structured Webapps. I also made some game and experiments with _canvas_ and _WebGL_.
- _NodeJS_ is my favourite webserver to create fast, modern and scalable __server-side__ applications. Moreover npm provide us a huge number of modules to handle websockets, some database driver for _MongoDB_, _redis_... However, I might also use Php frameworks like _Symfony_ or _Laravel_, from time to time.
