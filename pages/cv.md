During my first year, I have realized several unix projects, like (re)code - in C - some core functions (printf, ls) or a [complete shell](#shell).

#### Graphical interface

I have been able to experiment the SDL, and I have achieved several projects with MinilibX (superset of Epitech's LibX) :

- a "wireframe" able to generate a rendered image from a config file
- a raycasting engine creating a game similar to [Wolfenstein 3d](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D)

#### Prog elem'

An Epitech's module, during which I had to realize elementary programmation, like sorting algorythms or infinite numbers calculator.

### Scripting

I made some __Shell Script__ and command line tools in __Python__, __C__ or __Javascript__.


### Web development

- In __frontend development__  I used libraries like _requireJS_ and _backbone_ to create structured Webapps. I also made some games and experiments with _canvas_ and _WebGL_.

Moreover _NPM_ provides us a huge number of modules to handle websockets, some database driver for _MongoDB_, _redis_... Finally, I also use Php frameworks like _Symfony_ or _Laravel_, from time to time.
