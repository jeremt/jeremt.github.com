Resume

As a french developer and IT student at Epitech in Paris, I like to use innovative technologies to make experiments and applications on desktop, web and mobile platforms.

Projects
--------

### Computer graphics

During my first year, I made projets to implement some graphical concepts in C with LibX:

- an __isometric__ "wireframe" ground generate from a data file.
- a __raycasting__ engine creating a game similar to [Wolfenstein 3d](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D)
- a __raytracer__ implementing some raytracing effects (light, reflection, bump mapping...)

In partnership with [AMD](http://www.amd.com/) and Epitech Advanced Computer Science Laboratory, I worked on a C++ project for which we used OpenGL3 and OpenCL to create a 3D demonstration.

### Game Development

For my Epitech second year, I made 2 game in C++:

- a snake like game with multiple graphic interfaces (Ncurse, SFML, OpenGL)
- a C++ OpenGL based game engine and a bomberman like with nice 3D effects (particles, animations effects, camera...)

I made some simple HTML5 games with canvas (snake, doodle-jump like...) or WebGL (my website's [spaceship](game.html) game).

During this summer, I try [Unity3d](http://unity3d.com/) and I made 3 games:

- A simple 3d Arkanoid game in space with some nice particles and explosions effects.
- A spaceship race game with [Occulus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com/) support.
- A little arcarde game on Android and desktop with [the new Intel webcam](http://click.intel.com/intelsdk/Creative_Interactive_Gesture_Camera_Developer_Kit-P2061.aspx) in which you have to catch falling fruits and avoid chocolate ;).

Finally I worked on a retro adventure game as native android application.

### Web development

I like to make some web experiments using html5, Canvas, WegGL or NodeJS. You can get an overview of it on my [github](https://github.com/jeremt) ;).

### UNIX System

I have realized several unix projects, like (re)code - in C - some core functions (printf, ls) or a complete shell. I also experimented __POSIX Threads__ and __sockets__ with some school projets (like a client/server IRC).

### Scripting

I made some __Shell Script__ and command line tools in __Python__, __C__ or __Javascript__. You can take a look at [cppgen](https://github.com/jeremt/cppgen) or [boilertek](https://github.com/jeremt/boilertek) for example.


Jobs
----

### C++/Python developer at Stupeflix - from September 2013

Stupeflix is a french startup which provide a web service and an iPhone application to create customized videos. The Stupeflix engine use XML and Binary files on iPhone to compile videos. The engine is based on OpenSceneGraph C++ library and its python binding.

I'm currently doing my partime job at Stupeflix for my Epitech thrid year. I work on themes creation using the python binding and some C++ tools to improve Stupeflix engine features.

### C/Php teaching assistant - Mars 2013

The ETNA (École des technologies numériques appliquées) is a French private university in computer science. ETNA's students can prepare major certifications (Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Oracle) and two specializations are available: software development or system and computer network.

The assistant ETNA work involves acting as an teaching assistant among ETNA students. I learned them C and Php basics, helped them in their projects and also noted them.

### Bemyapp ambassador - since 2012

[BeMyApp](http://bemyapp.com) is organising events about web, mobile and new technologies. During the "BeMyApp Weekends", plurivalents teams composed of developers, designers, community managers and people carrying an idea are gathering to create an application in 48 hours.
Some meetups are also organized to allow some speakers to deliver lectures about interesting emerging technologies.

My role as an ambassador is to connect BeMyApp and the various schools, by promoting the events organized during the year. Besides, I also submit some tutorials on the [blog](http://ambassadeur.bemyapp.com/) (for instance an article about the [Dart language](http://ambassadeur.bemyapp.com/?p=149)).

### Web developer at Kontestapp - July 1st, 2012 to December 28th, 2012
