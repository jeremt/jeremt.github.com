Resume
======

As a french developer and IT student at Epitech in Paris, I like to use innovative technologies to make experiments and applications on desktop, web and mobile platforms.

What I do
---------

### UNIX System

I have realized several unix projects, like (re)code - in C - some core functions (printf, ls) or a complete shell. I also experimented __POSIX Threads__ and __sockets__ with some School projets (like a client/server IRC).

### Computer graphics

During my first year, I made some projets to implement some graphical concepts:
- an __isometric__ "wireframe" area generate from a data file.
- a __raycasting__ engine creating a game similar to [Wolfenstein 3d](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D)
- a __raytracer__ implementing some raytracing effects (light, reflection, bump mapping...)

### Game Development

For my Epitech second year, we made 2 game in C++:
- A snake like game with multiple graphic interfaces (Ncurse, SFML, OpenGL)
- A bomberman like coded in C++ with OpenGL

### Web development

I like to make some web experiments in Javascript using Canvas, WegGL and NodeJS.

### Scripting

I made some __Shell Script__ and command line tools in __Python__, __C__ or __Javascript__.


What I did
----------

### C/Php teaching assistant

The ETNA (École des technologies numériques appliquées) is a French private university in computer science. ETNA's students can prepare major certifications (Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Oracle) and two specializations are available: software development or system and computer network.

My responsibilities at ETNA involve acting as an teaching assistant among ETNA students. I learned them C and Php basics, helped them in their projects and also noted them.

### Bemyapp ambassador - since 2012

[BeMyApp](http://bemyapp.com) is organising events about web, mobile and new technologies. During the "BeMyApp Weekends", plurivalents teams composed of developers, designers, community managers and people carrying an idea are gathering to create an application in 48 hours.
Some meetups are also organized to allow some speakers to deliver lectures about interesting emerging technologies.

My role as an ambassador is to connect BeMyApp and the various schools, by promoting the events organized during the year. Besides, I also submit some tutorials on the [blog](http://ambassadeur.bemyapp.com/) (for instance an article about the [Dart language](http://ambassadeur.bemyapp.com/?p=149)).

### Web developer at Kontestapp - July 1st, 2012 to December 28th, 2012

Kontest is an automated platform which creates online contests connected to Facebook, web and mobile based systems. No only multichannel, Kontest is also a readymade service enabling customers to manage theirs events, by helping them to create a game online within a few minutes.
My responsability in the company was to realize the second version of the platform as a web-developer.

Education
---------

### Epitech - from 2012 to 2016

I am currently studying at Epitech (European Institute of Information Technology) where I learn about computer sciences.
The particularity of Epitech is to teach with practical cases which makes me autonomous and able to realize complete projects.
