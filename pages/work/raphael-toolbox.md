Raphael Toolbox
===============

Raphael Toolbox add some useful helpers to RaphaelJS that allow you to draw mathematical curves.
I made this tools because I had a lot of mathemetical project where I needed to draw mathematical curve, therefore I could use this to easily draw curves in my projects.
