My website
==========

It's a simple static website I made with html5/css3 and javascript.

How?
----

1. I load markdown files for each section. A section can contain a list of articles (using `{{articles}}` syntax).
2. When you click buttons css3 animations are triggered and you can navigations between the differents pages.
3. Eventually, I try to make it readable on desktop, tablets and mobile using responsive design and mediaqueries.
