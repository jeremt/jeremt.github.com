My website
==========

It's a simple static website I made with html5/css3 and javascript.

I load markdown files for each section. A section can contain a list of articles (using `{{articles}}` syntax).

When you click buttons css3 animations are triggered and you can navigations between the differents pages.

Eventually, I try to make it readable on desktop, tablets and mobile using responsive design and mediaqueries.
