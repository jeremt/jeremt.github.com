SpaceDemo
=========

I developed a demoscene using OpenGL3/OpenCL, in partnership with AMD & ACSEL Epitech laboratory. The demo reprensented a scene in space with asteroids, planets and explosions.

The main goal of the project was to create a great abstraction of OpenCL and last OpenGL api to create a optimized graphic scene.
